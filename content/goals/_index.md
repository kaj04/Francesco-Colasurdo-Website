*I like setting goals that are measurable through clear KPIs and concrete, objective sub-tasks.

Even when I set more abstract goals, I try to define tangible milestones to track and validate my progress.

I find it very helpful to work in “Quarters”, which don’t follow the usual business quarters but rather the academic ones, starting in September and lasting around ten weeks each.

This page will be updated quarter by quarter to increase personal accountability, keep my thoughts organized, and, above all, to connect with people who share similar goals or experiences, maybe even someone who’s already been there and can share their insights.

*Some goals will last throughout the year but evolve over time, all inspired by one simple principle: **“**Mens sana in corpore sano**.”** *
