            Perfection, excellent results, and AI-generated content are exactly what you won’t find on this webpage.
            This is my Personal Shared Web Space, a place where I want to tell my story authentically, through human, everyday experiences and anecdotes.
            The goal is to create a bridge between my technical skills and my human side.
            There will be a page dedicated to my CV, where you can discover what I do professionally, and a Personal Assistant (which you can already test live using the green button) where you can ask questions about my skills, experience, and personal projects.
            The rest of the website will instead focus on my personal side: passions, hobbies, reflections, and life lessons.
            I want to be deliberately imperfect, without filters or polish, because I truly care about being authentic and real.
            Through the blog, I’ll share thoughts, episodes, and reflections that I hope will leave you with something, make you smile, think, or spark a constructive debate between us.
            Finally, in the Actual Goals section, as the name suggests, I’ll talk about what I’m currently working on, hoping to find people pursuing similar goals who might want to collaborate, help out, or simply share ideas.

  <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
  <section class="paper-section" aria-labelledby="intro-title">
    <h2 id="intro-title" class="no-number">Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      print("Hello Visitor!") I’m Francesco, 21 years old, and I’ve just moved to the Netherlands.
      I’m curious to explore the world and its cultures, always searching for new perspectives.
      I study and am passionate about Statistics, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence, with the goal of applying this knowledge to real-world problems, to make processes more efficient and, why not, to enhance our everyday human experience.
      Nowadays it may sound banal or cliché, but I love traveling, not for photos or Instagram posts, but to discover the habits and traditions of human beings in different parts of the world.
      I’m deeply curious about how people live their daily lives, what brings them joy and happiness, what they aspire to, and how they interact with society.
      I love nature and outdoor activities, a passion that has been with me since my Scout days, where I learned to appreciate the world around us and to always leave a place better than I found it.
      I try to live by the motto “mens sana in corpore sano”: besides studying and reading, I dedicate time to sports, gym, swimming, and jump rope are my favorites.
      Sports have taught me that consistency and discipline matter more than motivation: they’re the true keys to achieving any goal.
      I consider myself efficient and well-organized, someone who values productivity not out of perfectionism, but to give proper value to time and enjoy every activity to the fullest.
      After this brief introduction, I hope I’ve caught your attention enough for you to explore the rest of the website: my blog, personal projects, and goals section.
      I’d love to get in touch with you, whether you’re a student or not, not only to talk about work or technology, but also to exchange ideas and reflections that help us both grow.
  </p>This website was born with two main goals:</p>
  <ul><li>To tell my story, to let people know who I am and to connect with those who share, or do not, my passions and perspectives, sparking constructive conversations.</li>
  <li>To put myself out there, by publishing what I usually write and sharing my personal reflections, hoping to receive feedback, insights, and new points of view.</li></ul>
  <p><em>Want me to make a “web-ready” version of this page? Just kidding, I’m a man of my word, and you’ll never find me using AI tools to make my thoughts sound inauthentic ;)
