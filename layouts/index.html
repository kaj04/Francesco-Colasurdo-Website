                        erfection, excellent results, and AI-generated content are exactly what you won’t find on this
                        webpage.
                        This is my <strong>Personal Shared Web Space</strong>, a place where I want to tell my story
                        authentically,
                        through human, everyday experiences and anecdotes. The goal is to create a bridge between my
                        technical skills and my human side. There will be a page dedicated to my CV, where you can
                        discover what I do professionally, and a Personal Assistant (which you can already test live
                        using the green button) where you can ask questions about my skills, experience, and personal
                        projects.

                    <p>
                        The rest of the website will instead focus on my personal side: passions, hobbies, reflections,
                        and life lessons. I want to be deliberately imperfect, without filters or polish, because I
                        truly care about being authentic and real. Through the blog, I’ll share thoughts, episodes, and
                        reflections that I hope will leave you with something, make you smile, think, or spark a
                        constructive debate between us. Finally, in the Actual Goals section, as the name suggests, I’ll
                        talk about what I’m currently working on, hoping to find people pursuing similar goals who might
                        want to collaborate, help out, or simply share ideas.

                    I’m Francesco, 21 years old, and I’ve just moved to the Netherlands. I’m curious to explore the
                    world and its cultures, always searching for new perspectives. I study and am passionate about
                    Statistics, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence, with the goal of applying this knowledge
                    to real-world problems, to make processes more efficient and, why not, to enhance our everyday human
                    experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nowadays it may sound banal or cliché, but I love traveling, not for photos or Instagram posts, but
                    to discover the habits and traditions of human beings in different parts of the world. I’m deeply
                    curious about how people live their daily lives, what brings them joy and happiness, what they
                    aspire to, and how they interact with society.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I love nature and outdoor activities, a passion that has been with me since my Scout days, where I
                    learned to appreciate the world around us and to always leave a place better than I found it. I try
                    to live by the motto <span class="italic font-semibold text-primary">“mens sana in corpore
                        sano”</span>: besides studying and reading, I dedicate time to sports, gym, swimming, and jump
                    rope are my favorites. Sports have taught me that consistency and discipline matter more than
                    motivation: they’re the true keys to achieving any goal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I consider myself efficient and well-organized, someone who values productivity not out of
                    perfectionism, but to give proper value to time and enjoy every activity to the fullest. After this
                    brief introduction, I hope I’ve caught your attention enough for you to explore the rest of the
                    website: my blog, personal projects, and goals section. I’d love to get in touch with you, whether
                    you’re a student or not, not only to talk about work or technology, but also to exchange ideas and
                    reflections that help us both grow.
                </p>
